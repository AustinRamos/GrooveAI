Music Recommendation API Project
Project Scope
The Music Recommendation API project aims to create a scalable and robust system that provides personalized music recommendations. The system will leverage machine learning models to analyze user listening habits and suggest tracks, artists, or genres that align with their preferences. The architecture will follow a microservices approach to ensure flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.

Objectives
Develop a system to fetch and process music data from external platforms like Spotify.
Implement a machine learning model to generate personalized music recommendations.
Create a user-friendly API for accessing recommendations and managing user profiles.
Utilize a message queue for efficient inter-service communication.
Key Features
User Authentication: Secure user login and profile management.
Music Data Integration: Fetching and storing music data from external sources.
Personalized Recommendations: Providing tailored music suggestions based on user preferences.
Microservices Architecture: Independent services for user management, music data processing, and recommendations.
Microservices
1. User Service
Purpose: Manages user authentication and profile information.

Endpoints:

POST /register: Register a new user.
POST /login: Authenticate a user.
GET /profile: Retrieve user profile information.
Technology: Node.js with Express

2. Music Data Service
Purpose: Handles fetching and storing music metadata from external platforms.

Endpoints:

GET /tracks: Fetch music tracks.
GET /artists: Fetch artist information.
POST /sync: Synchronize data with external music platforms.
Technology: Node.js with Express

3. Recommendation Service
Purpose: Generates music recommendations based on user data and preferences.

Endpoints:

POST /recommend: Generate recommendations for a user.
GET /model: Retrieve current recommendation model details.
Technology: Python with Flask

Architecture Overview
API Gateway: Routes requests to the appropriate microservice.
Message Queue: Facilitates communication between services using RabbitMQ.
Database: Stores user profiles and music metadata using PostgreSQL.
Containerization: Services are containerized with Docker for easy deployment.
Initial Setup
Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-recommendation-api.git
Install Dependencies:

Navigate to each service directory and install dependencies.
bash
Copy code
cd user-service
npm install
Repeat for other services.
Run Services Locally:

Use Docker Compose to start all services.
bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
Access API Endpoints:
